		I am a front end and back end web developer, a graduate of Electronics and Communication Engineering with huge passion of creating interactive and user friendly websites for small businesses. I keep in touch with latest technologies and strive to produce websites which are easy to maintain and are extensively user friendly in design.

		After graduating from Electronics and Communication Engineering branch in 2012, I worked in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia as an Electronic Engineer. I started building web pages as a part time hobby and later decided to make a career in which I have so much passion and interest. Before making a personal websites of my own, I have gone through each and every concept of web design and now I feel like I'm ready to feel the heat and work for real projects.

		 I have made many projects at home to enhance my coding skills and currently I am looking for some new projects to work with. I am looking to work as a freelancer and help small businesses with my web design skills.
